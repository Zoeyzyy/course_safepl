# Chapter 5. Auto Memory Reclaim
In the last lecture, we have studied the issues of memory exhaustion. 
If excluding the system memory limit, memory leakage is an essential bug type that may lead to heap exhaustion.
In this lecture, we will discuss the memory leakage problem and three types of countermeasures to mitigate the issue.

## 5.1 Problem: Memory Leakage

## 5.2 Compile-time Approach

## 5.3 Smart Pointers

## 5.4 Garbage Collection
